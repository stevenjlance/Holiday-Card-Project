# Holiday Card Project

**GOAL**: It’s the end of the year so you’ve decided to send out a holiday card to your friends and family! To save paper, you’ve decided to make a digital card that showcases your p5 skills. You will be sending this card out TOMORROW.

Your final holliday card should include:
- Animation and/or interactivity. Can either have items move when the card is opened and/or when they press certain keys
- Shapes colored using RGB values
- A conditional that resets the position of items when they go off the page.
- Text (bonus points for using Google Fonts!)
